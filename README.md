## Personal Website

## Framework and technology

This website was built with [React]("https://reactjs.org") + [Next.js]("https://nextjs.org")

This was my first experience with React and Next.js. It was a lot to take in, but also my best experience in front-end development yet. In contrast to writing pure HTML, it was refreshing to be able to modularise my pages and components so well.

Next.js allows for ridiculous fast loading time with their server side pre-rendering. See for yourself!
